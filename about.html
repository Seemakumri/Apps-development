            <p class="par">The concept entails what the application is going to hold. To identify the concept,you
                need to know a few things that will guide you. You need to know the purpose of the app, who your
                target audience is, how heavy you want the application to be and the number of users it can accommodate
                at any given time.How about looking into what you like doing and find inspiration from there? Another area 
                that can help you to select a concept is checking online. <br> Choosing a platform is significantly influenced by
                the type of audience you intend to reach. The most common operating systems (OS) available are Android, iOS, and Windows.
                Depending on who your audience is, you can choose from the three options. Remember the amount of funds you have will also
                limit the kind of platform you opt for. For example, you have to keep in mind  that iOS charges developers some cash to upload
                their applications to their mobile app store. As such, if you do not have this money, you might want to look at other options 
                that are free or less expensive.
